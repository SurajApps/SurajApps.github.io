# WhatsApp Web for Tablet

## Why I Made This
I needed the ability to use WhatsApp on a tablet, as they have larger screens and are easier to watch videos than on a small phone screen.

## Features
- View WhatsApp Messages
- View WhatsApp Videos
- View WhatsApp Images
- All features of WhatsApp Web integrated

## Installation
1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/SurajApps/WhatsApp-WebTab/releases/).
2. Click on the downloaded ```*.apk``` file.
3. Click allow wherever it mentions install apps from unknown sources.
4. The app should be installed on the device.
